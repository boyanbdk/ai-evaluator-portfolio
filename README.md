# AI Evaluator & Data Annotation Portfolio

Hi! 👋  
My name is Boyan. I’m a Computer Science student based in Sofia, Bulgaria, interested in **AI Data Annotation**, **AI Evaluation**, and **LLM training**.

This repository is a small portfolio that demonstrates how I:
- design and refine **prompts** for large language models,
- **evaluate** AI-generated answers using clear criteria,
- perform simple **text annotation** tasks (sentiment, topic, relevance).

The goal is to show how I think when working with AI systems, even before having formal work experience in the field.

## Contents

1. `prompts/prompt-library.md`  
   A collection of prompts I use or would use in realistic scenarios:
   - studying Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence,
   - analysing macroeconomic news and trading-related information,
   - language learning (French and German).

2. `evaluation-examples/llm-evaluation-examples.md`  
   Several examples where I:
   - compare two AI-generated answers (A vs B),
   - decide which one is better,
   - explain my reasoning using evaluation criteria (accuracy, completeness, clarity, etc.).

3. `annotation-examples/text-annotation-examples.md`  
   Simple datasets with:
   - short text snippets,
   - sentiment labels,
   - topic and relevance labels.

These examples are **manually created** to illustrate my approach and do not come from any specific AI system or client work.

## How I work with AI

- I use tools like ChatGPT to:
  - summarise lecture notes from my university courses in Computer Science,
  - prepare for exams in subjects such as Artificial Intelligence and Logical Programming,
  - analyse macroeconomic news and economic indicators for trading,
  - support language learning (French and German).

- When I use AI, I always:
  - check the output for **factual correctness**,
  - look for **missing context or important caveats**,
  - rewrite parts of the answer to be clearer and more precise.

This mindset is very close to the responsibilities of an **AI Data Annotator** or **AI Evaluator**, where the goal is to improve AI models through high-quality feedback and well-structured data.
